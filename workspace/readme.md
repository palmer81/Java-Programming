# Java Code Examples
#### Provided is a short description of each program. I am planning updating the descriptions and programs in the near future. Please <a href="mailto:palmer.sr@gmail.com?subject='Hi I have a comment'&body='Hey Scott, I have a comment about your stuff.'">PM me</a> if you have any suggestions or tips, Thanks. See additional about [me](https://palmer81.github.io/). 

1. [ATMsim](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/ATMsim/)

   This is a project that doesn't have a main() to it but there is the ATM, Bank, BankAccount and Customer. The classes are mostly complete but without a main method there is really only a framework here.

2. [Animation](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/Animation/)

   The main() is in SelectionSortViewer.java, without running the project in awhile all I can say is a JFrame is made with a 300x400 frame that will show in the top left corner. Hopefully an randomly made array will animate a selection sort.

3. [AstroidsLWJGL2](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/AstroidsLWJGL2/)

   This is an astroid game that used the Lightweight Java Game Library which can be found [here](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl/tree/master). Can't if this will work but it looks like everything is there to run the program. Ant would be the best way to run this project see the build.xml.

4. [Balls](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/Balls/)

   Simple swing demostration of balls falling.

5. [BinaryRaceGame](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/BinaryRaceGame/)

   This was a project I did with Mike Harris. We had four players that raced around the board and each player scored a position once they finished. There's no view but the player's do race.

6. [Checkers](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/Checkers/)

   This is meant to be a checkers program done in Java but there's not much done in this one.

7. [Colors](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/Colors/)

   This a color swirl example done in a Applet which really isn't used anymore as Chrome 42+ no longer supports applets.

8. [Database](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/Database/)

   This is a database program that is meant to create a database in a XML form and hold the table in a query format. This really failed to be come to life as it was really only an attempt to read and write to files. This likely going to be deleted

9. [ExampleApplet2](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/ExampleApplet2/)

   Two example Applets taken from a 1996 O'Reilly book. Both are very basic and only make a few buttons to see go [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/enable_browser.html) to see how get Applets to work.

10. [FileWriter](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/FileWriter/)

    Simple File Writer to create a file which writes the filename in the file if the file doesn't exist. The format of the code is really not that great.

11. [GreetingRunnable](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/GreetingRunnable/)

    This is Thread Class example that says Hello and Goodbye on separate threads.

12. [HelloWorld](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/HelloWorld/)

    The simple Hello World example.

13. [JMElabF09](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/JMElabF09/)

    JMonkeyEngine example ... this is knida old and [JMonkeyEngine](https://jmonkeyengine.org/start/) still is being updated.

14. [JOGLDemo3](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/JOGLDemo3/)

    JOGL Demo and newer demos can be found [here](https://jogamp.org/jogl/www/).

15. [LoadImageApp](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/LoadImageApp/)

    Simple image loading application that loads a single image in a frame.

16. [MatchGame](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/MatchGame/)

    This is a simple match game provided in a game development course. You are meant to match class with their course number.

17. [NoteProducer](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/NoteProducer/)

    NoteProducer is a guitar fret to note validator. You are to mentally guess the note with the cooresponding fret and then select the frett to see you if are correct. 

18. [RaceGameExample](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/RaceGameExample/)

    This is a racing game that offers you an option to roll a die and then move to a position. Another user gets to go and so forth until the all the users finish.

19. [RaceGameGroup&nbsp;copy](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/RaceGameGroup%20copy)

    Copy of the RaceGameGroup. Not sure what I was upto but I made a copy potentially to become a better programmer 

20. [RaceGameGroup](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/RaceGameGroup/)

    This a final copy that I submit as a project in a software development course.

21. [SeaCeature](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/SeaCeature/)

    Demo of a SeaCeature that can move balls as they float around and collide with one another.

22. [Select](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/Select/)

    This is a selection applicatin for the GLCanvas and the user can use the mouse to select the text within the Canvas.

23. [SimplexMethod](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/SimplexMethod/)

    This is a swing application for the Simplex Method. A list of linear functions is inputed and return is provided that shows the mathematical reduction of the system of equations.

24. [SyncBankAccount](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/SyncBankAccount/)

    This is a Bank Account Example that uses Lock to synchronize the bank transactions. Both the Deposit and Withdrawl functions are on a Thread that receives an account, amount of transaction, and number of transactions.

25. [TransfromAnim](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/TransfromAnim/)

    The TransformAnim performs animation of shapes, text and images rotating, scaling, shearing and translating around a surface.

27. [UnsyncBankAccount](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/UnsyncBankAccount/)

    This is a Bank Account Example that doesn't use locking like the other example. Everything else is the same.

28. [UnpdatingButton1](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/UnpdatingButton1/)

    This is an updating example but there is no main() to show the button in work.

29. [mp3Reader](https://github.com/palmer81/Java-Programming/tree/main/workspace/mp3Reader/)

    This is an mp3 tag reader that will read an mp3 file header information. There's a lot done at the time I found this to be needed but as time progress I stopped working on this. The main() is in the ID3 folder, I was following the standards and they are in my notes. Nothing really has changed with the ID3 since I work on the project. Let me what you think as have been following the standard.
