# Java Code Examples
#### Provided is a short description of each program. I am planning updating the descriptions and programs in the near future. Please <a href="mailto:palmer.sr@gmail.com?subject='Hi I have a comment'&body='Hey Scott, I have a comment about your stuff.'">PM me</a> if you have any suggestions or tips, Thanks. See additional about [me](https://palmer81.github.io/). 

1. ATMsim

   This is a project that doesn't have a main() to it but there is the ATM, Bank, BankAccount and Customer. The classes are mostly complete but without a main method there is really only a framework here.

2. Animation

   The main() is in SelectionSortViewer.java, without running the project in awhile all I can say is a JFrame is made with a 300x400 frame that will show in the top left corner. Hopefully an randomly made array will animate a selection sort.

3. AstroidsWJGL2

   This is an astroid game that used the Lightweight Java Game Library which can be found [here](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl/tree/master). Can't if this will work but it looks like everything is there to run the program. Ant would be the best way to run this project see the build.xml.

4. Balls

   Simple swing demostration of balls falling.

5. BinaryRaceGame

   This was a project I did with Mike Harris. We had four players that raced around the board and each player scored a position once they finished. There's no view but the player's do race.

6. Checkers

   This is meant to be a checkers program done in Java but there's not much done in this one.

7. Colors

   This a color swirl example done in a Applet which really isn't used anymore as Chrome 42+ no longer supports applets.

8. Database

   This is a database program that is meant to create a database in a XML form and hold the table in a query format. This really failed to be come to life as it was really only an attempt to read and write to files. This likely going to be deleted

9. ExampleApplet2

   Two example Applets taken from a 1996 O'Reilly book. Both are very basic and only make a few buttons to see go [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/enable_browser.html) to see how get Applets to work.

10. FileWriter

   Simple File Writer to create a file which writes the filename in the file if the file doesn't exist. The format of the code is really not that great.

11. GreetingRunnable

   This is Thread Class example that says Hello and Goodbye on separate threads.

12. HelloWorld

   The simple Hello World example.

13. JMElabF09

   JMonkeyEngine example ... this is knida old and [JMonkeyEngine](https://jmonkeyengine.org/start/) still is being updated.

14. JOGLDemo3

   JOGL Demo and newer demos can be found [here](https://jogamp.org/jogl/www/).

15. LoadImageApp

   Simple image loading application that loads a single image in a frame.

16. MatchGame

   This is a simple match game provided in a game development course. You are meant to match class with their course number.

17. NoteProducer

   NoteProducer is a guitar fret to note validator. You are to mentally guess the note with the cooresponding fret and then select the frett to see you if are correct. 

18. RaceGameExample

   This is a racing game that offers you an option to roll a die and then move to a position. Another user gets to go and so forth until the all the users finish.

19. RaceGameGroup copy

   Copy of the RaceGameGroup. Not sure what I was upto but I made a copy potentially to become a better programmer 

20. RaceGameGroup

   This a final copy that I submit as a project in a software development course.

21. SeaCeature

   Demo of a SeaCeature that can move balls as they float around and collide with one another.

22. Select

   This is a selection applicatin for the GLCanvas and the user can use the mouse to select the text within the Canvas.

23. SimplexMethod

   This is a swing application for the Simplex Method. A list of linear functions is inputed and return is provided that shows the mathematical reduction of the system of equations.

24. SyncBankAccount

   This is a Bank Account Example that uses Lock to synchronize the bank transactions. Both the Deposit and Withdrawl functions are on a Thread that receives an account, amount of transaction, and number of transactions.

25. TransfromAnim

   The TransformAnim performs animation of shapes, text and images rotating, scaling, shearing and translating around a surface.

26. TutorialProject - POVRay not Java

   This logo was the one that won the POV-Ray Logo Contest held and organized by Rune S. Johansen in year 2000 and monitored by the POV-Team.

27. UnsyncBankAccount

   This is a Bank Account Example that doesn't use locking like the other example. Everything else is the same.

28. UnpdatingButton1

   This is an updating example but there is no main() to show the button in work.

29. mp3Reader

   This is an mp3 tag reader that will read an mp3 file header information. There's a lot done at the time I found this to be needed but as time progress I stopped working on this. The main() is in the ID3 folder, I was following the standards and they are in my notes. Nothing really has changed with the ID3 since I work on the project. Let me what you think as have been following the standard.

30. nim

   An Intelligent Nim Computer Game. Initial source code from Jeff Friesen's 6/21/2004 article

31. nimOrig

   Original version as the other was a submittion for a course. An Intelligent Nim Computer Game. Initial source code from Jeff Friesen's 6/21/2004 article
